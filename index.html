<h1>Kristof enyi</h1>
<p>Welcome to this website, which i created as a 0th homework for GreenFox academy.</p>
<p>This is actually not my first HTML markup work, as i have learned CSS and HTML back in 2000.
Back then i have created a website for my Coutner-Strike(1.5) clan using html and css in plain editor.
</p>
<p>
I used iframe tags to create a dynamic website, that dont need to reload to display another content. By clicking the links in menu, new data from a file such as "xy.html" was loaded to main frame. It was really bad.
But it worked</p>

<p>Just today i was accepted from the waiting list to create an account at OpenAI projec Dalle-2, which is an AI that generates quite amazing images.</p>
<p>I will try to create a responsive 3 by 3 gallery with images generated by dalle </p>

<h3>You can use Artificial Intelligence to generate text.</h3>
<p class="lh">When I started working with the AI, I thought: "I'll just try this out and see what happens." But now that we've tried it out, it's clear to me that the AI isn't ready yet. It can generate text, but not well enough for my needs. With some further development, though, it could become a powerful tool for writers and business owners alike. The state-of-the-art is pretty great already!</p>
